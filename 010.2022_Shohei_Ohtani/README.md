- hohei Ohtani, recognized as one of the premier baseball players globally, showcased outstanding performance in the 2022 season. Despite not securing the final MVP title, his accomplishments undeniably place him at the pinnacle of the sport. In a season marked by heightened competition and noteworthy achievements (such as Aaron Judge's historically high home runs), Ohtani maintained a batting performance comparable to his previous year. Notably, while his batting statistics remained consistent, his pitching performance saw a remarkable improvement compared to the 2021 season.
- In this project, my analysis will delve into the factors contributing to Ohtani's sustained batting prowess and explore the adjustments he made to enhance his pitching capabilities.
